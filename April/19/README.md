#### 2021 December 1st

I started playing Tree World again today. Last night when doing research on the Play Forge company, this game caught my eyes, and I have now been able to confirm it was one of the older games I played back in my early childhood, for a decent amount of time.

Today, I focused on gameplay. I got my tree planted, and raised it up 13 branches. I rescued several animals, and made lots of progress. I had an extremely long session today. Originally, I thought it was going to be difficult to document and play, but it is really easy. The game wanted access to make phone calls, and I denied that. Luckily, it wasn't a requirement. They couldn't really do anything anyway, since my phones SIM card is completely corrupted, and no longer in the phone.

I plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Wednesday December 1st

#### 2021 December 2nd

I started playing Tree World again today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 15) and to expand to 16, I first have to feed the second tree egg for over 30000 tree food. I saved up over 10000 tree food, then quit. I wanted to have a shorter session today, but it still dragged on for a while. I still plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work harder on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Thursday December 2nd

#### 2021 December 3rd

I played Tree World for a 3rd consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was still a bit slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 17) a lot of the time was needed to hatch the 2nd tree egg. Once I reached branch 16, all fruit collected doubled in value. I saved up over 1000 tree food, then quit. I wanted to have a shorter session today, but it still dragged on for a while. I still plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work even harder on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Friday December 3rd

#### 2021 December 4th

I played Tree World for a 4th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was still a bit slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 19) I did my first rescue mission today, I was forced to. I managed to quit early, as my battery ran low when I felt satisfied with my progress, so I was able to quit earlier.. - 2021 Saturday December 4th

#### 2021 December 5th

I played Tree World for a 5th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a bit faster. I raised my tree up 4 branches (to branch 23) but did not expand the 23rd branch at all. I did my first rescue mission today, I originally decided not to, but decided to just go for it. I forgot how much tree food these missions reward. I also used the critter capsule machine and got 1 free crit. I quit after a nearly 2 hour session, as my battery ran low, and I felt like doing more another day. - 2021, Sunday, December 5th

#### 2021 December 6th

I played Tree World for a 6th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. I did my third rescue mission today. I forgot how much tree food these missions reward. My starter critters were unable to level up today, as I didn't play until the time that they were originally rescued 5 days ago. I started work on an open source alternative to this game today as well. I quit after a nearly 2 hour session, as my battery ran low, and I felt like doing more another day. - 2021, Monday, December 6th

#### 2021 December 7th

I played Tree World for a 7th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I did not raise my tree up, and I had to quit before I could hatch the tree egg. I did my fourth rescue mission today. My starter critters leveled up today, I expected a massive amount of popups upon opening the application, but it was a lot better, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I earned my first vitagem from critter collection, and had a long session. I quit after a nearly 2 hour session, as my battery ran low, and I felt like doing more another day. - 2021, Tuesday, December 7th

#### 2021 December 8th

I played Tree World for an 8th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was better, and I managed to stop myself earlier on. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I hatched the 3rd tree egg today, and raised my tree up 2 and a half branches. I did my fifth rescue mission today. My second day starter critters leveled up today, at first, it seemed like they weren't going to level up today, but they did, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I also upgraded the den twice today, the first 2 upgrades cost 5000 tree food each. After the first upgrade, I thought all the upgrades were going to cost the same or cost vitagems. After the 2nd upgrade, upgrades cost 10000 tree food each. I still don't have the exact pattern of costs nailed down, but the 12 extra slots I have will help me out, as I have been struggling to keep 1 species per branch.

Despite quitting early, I still had a along session, I just didn't drain my battery before quitting. I quit after a nearly 1 and a hakf hour session, I decided to quit. - 2021, Wednesday, December 8th

#### 2021 December 9th

I played Tree World for a 9th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was better, and I managed to stop myself earlier on. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I hatched the 3rd tree egg today, and raised my tree up 3 and a half branches. I did my sixth rescue mission today. My third day starter critters leveled up today, at first, it seemed like they weren't going to level up today, but they did, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I played for an extensive period, as I felt like doing so. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 2 and a half hour session. - 2021, Thursday, December 9th

#### 2021 December 10th

I played Tree World for a 10th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was better, but the game crashed once. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 2 branches today. When the game crashed early on, tree food wasn't collectable, and all the textures were glitched. I had to restart the app. I heard of a bug where sometimes the game crashes and tree food and vita gems are swapped. I cannot confirm this still, and it didn't happen following the crash. I did my seventh rescue mission today. My fourth day starter critters leveled up today, at first, it seemed like they weren't going to level up today, but they did, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I played for an extensive period, as I felt like doing so. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 2 and a half hour session. 

There were several things I forgot to mention yesterday, such as the fruit bonus increasing after reaching branch 30, and the fairy being unlocked at branch 30. The fairy is a paid option to auto-collect all tree food, but the first usage is free. I am unable to test it out further, and I don't feel like paying for it to trial it out yet, as I am saving up for other things first (as of today, I am 1 vitagem away from upgrading Pippy to level 3) 

Also today, I upgraded my den for a 3rd time for 10000 tree food, the fourth upgrade costs 20000, so the pattern broke again. - 2021, Friday, December 10th

#### 2021 December 11th

I played Tree World for a 11th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was OK. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 2 branches today. I did my eighth rescue mission today, rescuing a panda. My fifth day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a shorter period of time, as I didn't have as much battery. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 1 hour 45 minute session. 

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy for free again today, and got a limited critter from a capsule opening. I upgraded Pippy with 75 vitagems, thinking it would be the last upgrade. There is a 4th one that costs 200 vitagems. I later earned a vitagem from critter collection. The sky texture is a bit glitched, and I am wondering what will happen once I reach branch 36, if it will stay like this or not. - 2021, Saturday, December 11th

#### 2021 December 12th

I played Tree World for a 12th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was OK. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1 branch today. I did my ninth rescue mission today, rescuing a sprite. My sixth day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a shorter period of time, as I didn't have as much battery. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 1 hour 30 minute session. 

I got distracted with the family cat at the beginning, she was in my room, and I had to pet her, so I didn't play as much for the first 20 minutes.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy for free again today, and I tried out the paid use. Apparently, it costs 2 vitagems per use, so it is completely not worth it, and you should just use the free cycle once a day. The sky texture is still bit glitched, and I am wondering what will happen once I reach branch 36, if it will stay like this or not.

Today, I reached the most expensive tree keeper to date, it costs over 300,000 tree food to hatch. I got a little over 18% done getting up to this cost, but it is going to take me 1-4 more days to get past it. I unlocked level 4 plants today, and am now at 13.62% (41/301) completion on the discovery of all critters. - 2021, Sunday, December 12th

#### 2021 December 13th

I played Tree World for a 13th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was OK, I started much later today.. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 0 branches today. I did my tenth rescue mission today, rescuing a fox. My seventh day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a longer amount of time, but didn't completely drain my battery.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy (Patty) for free again (twice) today. I am still working on hatching the next tree keeper, I am over 62% done with it now. It will take 1-3 more days to save up for it. I did 1 adventure today, and got a duplicate critter. Out of the 4 new critters I received today, only one was previously undiscovered. I also earned 1 vitagem from tree collection. - 2021, Monday, December 13th

#### 2021 December 14th

I played Tree World for a 14th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was OK, I started much earlier today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1.5 branches today. I did my eleventh rescue mission today, rescuing a boar (my 2nd one). My eighth day starter critters leveled up today, at first I didn't think they were going to, but I received the option later on. I played for a longer amount of time, and drained my battery down to 2%.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy (Patty) for free again (once) today. I hatched the new tree keeper today, and struggled to raise the tree up further due to how much I spent on the tree keeper. It took me 3 sessions to hatch this tree egg. I did 1 adventure today, and got a duplicate critter. Out of the 5 new critters I received today, only three were previously undiscovered. I currently have 52 out of 301 critters, totaling 17.28% of all critter types collected. I paired up more critters today. I considered coming back to play again once my battery charged, but I decided notto. - 2021, Tuesday, December 14th

Today, gameplay was OK, I started a bit earlier today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1.5 branches again today. I did my twelfth rescue mission today, rescuing a camel (my 1st one, originally I thought I already had one). My ninth day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a long time, but didn't drain the battery down below 6%

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy at all today, and tree upgrades are becoming too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I did 1 adventure today, and got a new critter. Out of the 4 new critters I received today, only three were previously undiscovered. I currently have 55 out of 301 critters, totaling 18.27% of all critter types collected. - 2021, Wednesday, December 15th

I did my thirteenth rescue mission today, rescuing a  (my 1st one). My tenth day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a long time, but didn't drain the battery down below 6%

I got a full pair of snailwads today, another set of critters for a branch. I also found that 5 fruits can grow simultaneously starting at branch 40. The sky texture is not recovering still, so once I get past 42 branches, I feel the background will just be nothing but black.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy at all again today, and tree upgrades are becoming too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was able to do so today. I did 1 adventure today, and got a new critter. Out of the 4 new critters I received today, only three were previously undiscovered.

Today, gameplay was OK, I started a bit later again today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1 branch today, it now costs over 100,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. I made it to branch 41 today. I did my fourteenth rescue mission today, rescuing a penguin (my 1st one). My elevennth day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a long time, but didn't drain the battery down below 10% as I did not have an available battery to charge from, and I forced myself to quit earlier.

I got a full pair of zebras today, another set of critters for a branch. I also earned 1 vitagem from collection. The sky texture is not recovering still, so once I get past 42 branches, I feel the background will just be nothing but black.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy at all again today, and tree upgrades are becoming too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day.

I earned 1 vitagem from early collection today. My tree is completely full now as well. Also today,I  accidentally performed the critter duplication glitch by pressing the cancel button before it completely loaded. I got an extra Armadillo. I did not want to perform the glitch, I might evict the critter.

After reaching branch 50, I found that 6 fruits can now grow at the same time.

#### 2021 December 24th

I played Tree World for a 24th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was again repetitive, I started a bit later today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1 branch today, it costs over 200,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. I made it to branch 51 today. I did my twenty-first rescue mission today, rescuing a Seal (my 1st one). My eighteenth day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 1 starter critters (to level 3) there was a ton of leveling up in the beginning.. I played for a long time (over 2.02 hours) and quit after draining my battery.

After creating branch 51, the price of creating new branches doubled, and now it is much harder to keep going, so I upgraded my den twice just in case. My tree was still completely full, and I couldn't place 3 critters. The first upgrade today costs 20000, then the second cost 35000. The next one will cost 60000.

I used the critter capsule machine today. I am over 26% there for affording the next branch.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy today, and tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was not able to do so today, only raising my tree up 1 branch. I did 1 adventure today. Out of the 6 new critters I received today, 4 were previously undiscovered. I currently have 86 out of 301 critters, totaling 28.57% of all critter types collected. - 2021, Friday, December 24th

I played Tree World for a 25th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was lesser, I started a lot later today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 0.75 branches today, it costs over 256,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. I stayed with branch 51 today. I did my twenty-second rescue mission today, rescuing a Stegosaurus (my 1st one). My nineteenth day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 2 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday. I played for a lot less time today, as I started with less battery, and quit after draining my battery.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy today, and tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was not able to do so today, not able to raise my tree up a full branch. I did 1 adventure today. Out of the 4 new critters I received today, 3 were previously undiscovered. I currently have 89 out of 301 critters, totaling 29.57% of all critter types collected. - 2021, Saturday, December 25th

I played Tree World for a 26th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a bit longer. I started a lot later today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 0.25 branches today, it costs over 265,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. I managed to raise my tree up to branch 52 today. I did my twenty-third rescue mission today, rescuing a Leafy Sea Dragon (my 1st one). My twentieth day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 3 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday. I played for a bit more time today, as I started with more battery, and quit after draining my battery. I also upgraded my den for 60,000 tree food today, the next upgrade costs 100,000 tree food. I wonder if at some point, the upgrades are going to start costing Vitagems.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I used the fairy at the beginning today for convenience, and tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was not able to do so today, only able to raise my tree up 0.25 branches (1 branch) I did 1 adventure today. Out of the 4 new critters I received today, only 2 were previously undiscovered. I currently have 91 out of 301 critters, totaling 30.23% of all critter types collected. I am considering not summoning new critters each day due to not enough space. - 2021, Sunday, December 26th

I played Tree World for a 27th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot longer.

I played for a bit more time today, as I started with more battery, and quit after draining my battery.

I used the critter capsule machine today. Today, I spent some time remodeling the first 20 branches of my tree, so that I would have 1 of each plant type. I plan to do the same for branch 21 to 25 when I unlock level 5 plants, then everything after that will be versatile in the future.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I used the fairy later on by accident, and tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day.

My twenty-second day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 5 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday.

The game was very unstable today. The first time it bugged out, it refused to grow fruit, so I excited. One of my critters now has a weird loading icon upon each game reload. Shortly after recovering, the game did the texture glitch. It did not crash any further today. Today I also did my first critter exchange to see what it was like, and I also summoned critters today due to having enough den space agaim.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy ahgainn today, and tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day.

I played Tree World for a 31st consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot longer. I started a lot later today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1 branch today, it costs over 315,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. I raised up to branch 56 today. I did my twenty-eighth rescue mission today, rescuing an road runner (my 1st one). My twenty-fifth day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 8 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday. I played for a bit more time today, as I started with more battery, and quit after running low on battery.

The adventure today gave out a pretty decent reward, but it really hasn't been much help in raising my tree up other than that. I also recently found out what went missing from my tree: my strawnose (my best critter) I was very frustrated, and almost quit early upon realization, but I decided to keep playing. I hope to re-receive it again, and not have the game delete it.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy again today, and tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was not able to do so today, only able to raise my tree up 01 branches. I did 1 adventure today. I currently have 103 out of 301 critters, totaling 34.22% of all critter types collected.

My twenty-ixth day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day98 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday. I played for a lot less today, as I started with more battery, and quit after running low on battery.

The adventure today gave out a pretty decent reward, but it really hasn't been much help in raising my tree up other than that. It helped out a bit today. Today I also upgraded my den to 27 slots for 100,000 tree food. The next upgrade will cost 150,000. 

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I used the fairy today, as there was a free use, and tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day.

Even though the level 5 plants give 5% more than the level 6 plants, I plan to only place level 6 plants from branch 26 and up to follow my design. I plan on getting 1 of each type of level 5 plant from branch 21 to 25, of which I have already done 2.

Today, I accidentally wasted 8 vitagems on a level 5 plant, as I didn't intend to place it where I did. Along with the tree upgrade, the fruit bonus increased from 1, 4, 20, 100, 200, and 400 to 1, 5, 25, 125, 250, and 500. It still has a maximum of 6 fruits that can be grown at once.

I reached the 5th tree keeper today. It is going to be difficult to get past, but it is not as bad as I expected. I expected it to be a lot more expensive (more like 1,000,000 or more tree food, rather than 800,754) it is still going to take me a few days to get past it.

I did not receive any new critters today. From the adventure, I received a Koala, which was a duplicate.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy today. Tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was not able to do so today, only able to raise my tree up 0.75 branches. I did 1 adventure today. I currently have 112 out of 301 critters, totaling 37.21% of all critter types collected.

Legendary: 1/50 (02.00% of all types collected)

Limited: 5/60 (08.33% of all types collected)

I am still considering not summoning new critters each day due to not enough space. I did NOT summon new critters today, as I had no reasonable available space. <!-- I made progress on getting to a new branch today, I just didn't spend the tree food on expanding yet out of fear of the expansion being deleted.

#### 2022 January 8th

I played Tree World for a 39th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot shorter. I started a lot later today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 0 today. It costs over 362,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, and another tree keeper is NOW ACTIVE, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. I did my forty-first rescue mission today, rescuing a SproutKid (my 1st one) My 33rd day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 16 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday. I played for a normal amount of time today, as I started with more battery, and quit after draining it to 6%. I split my second in 4, I intended to split it in 3, but the game wasn't functional the second time (ads weren't functional, which was what I was trying to go for, more on that below) and I ended up only getting 1 more offer for the day.

The adventure today gave out a pretty bad reward, but it really hasn't been much help in raising my tree up other than that. It didn't help out very much today. Today, I spent the rest of my Vitagems on versatile and level 5 branches, until I didn't have enough vitagems for anything. My branches are almost to the way I want them, I just need about 56 more Vitagems (not an exact calculation)

As hinted earlier, I began "watching" ads for vitagems. I should have made use of this earlier on. I appear to only be able to "watch" 5 ads per 24 hours.

I summoned critters today, but received only duplicates. I made use of them, and paired them up on my tree. I plan to upgrade my den repeatedly, until the upgrades cost more than the tree keeper. Today, I upgraded my den to 33 slots for 250,000 tree food. The next upgrade will cost 400,000 tree food, so I am going to stay at branch 60 for a while.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I used the fairy on purpose today just because I could. Tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was not able to do so today, only able to raise my tree up 0 branches. I did 1 adventure today. I currently have 113 out of 301 critters, totaling 37.54% of all critter types collected.

I played Tree World for a 42nd consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was extremely large in length. I started a lot earlier today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1 branch today. It costs over 400,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down.

I played for a very long amount of time today, as I started with more battery, and quit after draining it to a low amount multiple times. I split my session into several parts. I could have done a 2nd adventure today, but decided not to.

The adventure today gave out a pretty bad reward, but it really hasn't been much help in raising my tree up other than that. It didn't help out very much today. Today, I spent the rest of my Vitagems on versatile and level 5 branches, finally reaching my goal.

Today, I decided not to upgrade my den. I decided to hatch the tree keeper instead, as I needed to progress. I unlocked a giraffe from the tree keeper, and raised up 1 more branch before quitting.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I used the fairy by accident today. Tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was not able to do so today, only able to raise my tree up 1 branch. I did 1 adventure today. I currently have 117 out of 301 critters, totaling 38.87% of all critter types collected.

I played Tree World for a 43rd consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was long in length, but MUCH shorter than yesterday. I started a bit later today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 0.75 branch today.

The adventure today gave out a pretty bad reward, but it really hasn't been much help in raising my tree up other than that. It didn't help out very much today. I was unable to watch ads for vitagems today, as it was taking too long for 24 hours to go by, and I decided to save it for tomorrow, so I can control the time again.

I did not upgrade my den today. I feel like I am close to being screwed storage wise, and likely will not be able to get any new critters at the current rate. I opened a critter capsule today, and unlocked a gorilla today, this didn't help.

I played Tree World for a 48th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was shorter in length, my shortest session to date. I started a lot earlier today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 0 branches today. It costs over 452,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. <!-- I did my fortieth rescue mission today, rescuing a Blue Bird (my 1st one) !--> I did NOT do any rescue missions today, as I am too low on space, and need to get more. My 40th day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 22 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday. I played for a shorter amount of time today, as I had less time in the morning, and needed to devote time to other tasks, and quit early on.

<!--The adventure today gave out a pretty bad reward, but it really hasn't been much help in raising my tree up other than that. It didn't help out very much today. I was unable to watch ads for vitagems today, as it was taking too long for 24 hours to go by, and I decided to save it for tomorrow, so I can control the time again.!-->

I did not watch 5 ads for 10 vitagems today or raise my tree up at all.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy today. Tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was not able to do so today, only able to raise my tree up 0 branches. I did 0 adventures today. I currently have 120 out of 301 critters, totaling 39.87% of all critter types collected.

Common: 44/62 (70.97% of all types collected)

I started a bit later today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 0.25 branches today. It costs over 610,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. <!-- I did my fortieth rescue mission today, rescuing a Blue Bird (my 1st one) !--> I did NOT do any rescue missions today, as I am trying to save space, and need to get more. My 60th day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 42 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday. I played for a significantly longer amount of time today, and split across several sessions. <!-- I have a new system to play for less than 25 minutes per day.!-->

<!--The adventure today gave out a pretty bad reward, but it really hasn't been much help in raising my tree up other than that. It didn't help out very much today. I was unable to watch ads for vitagems today, as it was taking too long for 24 hours to go by, and I decided to save it for tomorrow, so I can control the time again.!-->

I did not watch 5 ads for 10 vitagems today, as I was unable to when the time came, and didn't want to go through the frustrating process of opening and closing the game repeatedly, and attempting over and over. It simply isn't worth it. <!-- as it has been too difficult to do it (since I have to constantly reload the game) !--> but I raised my tree up 0.5 branches today. I did not do any adventures today. I started slightly later today, and split the session across multiple periods.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy today. Tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I did 0 adventures today. I currently have 125 out of 301 critters, totaling 41.53% of all critter types collected.

Other current critter stats:

Common: 44/62 (70.97% of all types collected)

Rare: 29/64 (45.31% of all types collected)

Legendary: 3/50 (06.00% of all types collected)

Limited: 6/60 (10.00% of all types collected)

I am still considering not summoning new critters each day due to not enough space. I did NOT summon new critters today, because I had no reasonable available space. I want to be able to have more for strategy, but keeping a balance is difficult. <!-- I made progress on getting to a new branch today, I just didn't spend the tree food on expanding yet out of fear of the expansion being deleted. There is still the variable of tree food getting deleted, it is a buggy game, and I don't know what to expect. !--> - 2022, Sunday, February 6th

I played Tree World for 78th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot shorter in length, but I was a bit more in control of the time today.

It costs over 685,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. <!-- I did my fortieth rescue mission today, rescuing a Blue Bird (my 1st one) !--> I decided to let loose and summon critters and do an adventure yet again today. From the adventure, I got a poor amount of tree food, and unlocked a second caterpillow. When summoning critters, I discovered 1 critter: Poodle. My 70th day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 61 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday. I split across several sessions yet again today. <!-- I have a new system to play for less than 25 minutes per day.!-->

<!--The adventure today gave out a pretty bad reward, but it really hasn't been much help in raising my tree up other than that. It didn't help out very much today.

I did not watch 5 ads for 10 vitagems today, as I was unable to when the time came, and didn't want to go through the frustrating process of opening and closing the game repeatedly, and attempting over and over.

I started a lot earlier today, and split the session across multiple periods. I was going to have 1 more session, but decided not to.

During my first session today, I worked on my Tree World Wiki project while playing, so it may have seemed like a sporadic session. I went and documented the names of every critter I have unlocked, along with 3 extras. This Wiki project is new, and due to it, it motivated me to play for over an hour on my first session today.

I did not use the fairy today. I also did 1 adventure today, getting a second caterpillow. I currently have 133 out of 301 critters, totaling 44.19% of all critter types collected.

Other current critter stats:

Recently, I have been summoning critters and doing adventures again. I want to keep progress going, and have a more full den. It still feels a little disappointing to fall behind on the animals on tree to den capacity ratio. <!-- I made progress on getting to a new branch today, I just didn't spend the tree food on expanding yet out of fear of the expansion being deleted.

I have been earnings lots of vitagems from collection recently. Unfortunately, I was unable to expand my tree today. I didn't devote very much time to the game compared to yesterday.

I collected at least 3 vitagems from my first wave of collection today. I also unlocked a snowman (limited) from a critter capsule.

I forgot to do any subsequent session, as I was really busy. I only had a ~35 minute session today.

<!--The adventure today gave out a pretty bad reward, but it really hasn't been much help in raising my tree up other than that. It didn't help out very much today. I was unable to watch ads for vitagems today, as it was taking too long for 24 hours to go by, and I decided to save it for tomorrow, so I can control the time again.!-->

I did not use the fairy today. I currently have 140 out of 301 critters, totaling 46.51% of all critter types collected.

I started a lot later on today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 0.5 branches today (to branch 90) and built the branch halfway.

I am placing all the 30/15 minute collection time non-duplicate critters on my tree right now, next I will do the the 2 hour ctime, then 1 hour ctime, then the rest. It costs over 940,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch. <!-- I did my fortieth rescue mission today, rescuing a Blue Bird (my 1st one) !--> My 92nd day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 84 starter critters (to level 3) I split across over 3 sessions today. <!-- I have a new system to play for less than 25 minutes per day.!-->

<!--The adventure today gave out a pretty bad reward, but it really hasn't been much help in raising my tree up other than that. It didn't help out very much today.

I did not receive any new critters today. Also, the moment I expanded to branch 90 (without doing the next 4 steps of branch growth) tree food rewards from tree fruit went up:

1 -> 1

6 -> 7

30 -> 35

150 -> 175

300 -> 375

600 -> 700

I did not use the fairy today. I currently have 146 out of 301 critters, totaling 48.50% of all critter types collected.

I played Tree World for a 127th/126th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was longer in length. I started a bit earlier on today, and had shorter sessions but played for more time in range, it was mostly mass collection as usual. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> It costs over 1,150,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch. <!-- I did my fortieth rescue mission today, rescuing a Blue Bird (my 1st one) !--> My 117th day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 109 starter critters (to level 3) and also my day 5 critters to level 4, which is apparently the max critter level. I split across over 5 sessions today. <!-- I have a new system to play for less than 25 minutes per day.!-->

<!--The adventure today gave out a pretty bad reward, but it really hasn't been much help in raising my tree up other than that. It didn't help out very much today. I was unable to watch ads for vitagems today, as it was taking too long for 24 hours to go by, and I decided to save it for tomorrow, so I can control the time again.!-->

I raised my tree up 0 branches today. My interest in the game has waned severely recently (starting around 2022 March 27th), but I intend to keep playing until I reach my goals.

My second to last session was a failure, I accidentally went on an adventure when I was trying to check the critter capsule machine, and unlocked a bearded dragon, but I messed up the screenshots for this, and for collecting tree fruit. I did not know that a single tap would close the adventure prompt, and my PDA had a glitch where the screenshot didn't go through for one portion.

Upon completing branch 100, another tree keeper appeared. This tree keeper costs 2,049,156 tree food to hatch, and will take a few days for me to finish. I am very close, and expect to finish it tomorrow.

I did not use the fairy. I currently have 158 out of 301 critters, totaling 52.49% of all critter types collected.

I played Tree World for a 139th/138th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was longer in length. I started a bit earlier on today, and had shorter sessions but played for more time in range, it was mostly mass collection as usual. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> It costs over 1,360,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch. <!-- I did my fortieth rescue mission today, rescuing a Blue Bird (my 1st one) !--> My 129th day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 120 starter critters (to level 3) and also my day 16 critters to level 4, which is apparently the max critter level. I split across over 4 sessions today. <!-- I have a new system to play for less than 25 minutes per day.!-->

<!--The adventure today gave out a pretty bad reward, but it really hasn't been much help in raising my tree up other than that. It didn't help out very much today. I was unable to watch ads for vitagems today, as it was taking too long for 24 hours to go by, and I decided to save it for tomorrow, so I can control the time again.!-->

I raised my tree up 0.5 branches today. My interest in the game has waned severely recently (starting around 2022 March 27th), but I intend to keep playing until I reach my goals.

I have been using a new collection submethod for several days now, where I scroll to the top first to even out all errors (critters not appearing, critters not loading) then scrolling back to the bottom, and collecting upward normally (this time without error) I noticed a consistent pattern that all glitches seem to stop between branch 65 and branch 80.

I have now noted that errors are occuring even higher up now.

I did an adventure today, and unlocked a macaque (rare) I had several sessions today, spreading over 8 hours, and having a very long play duration.

I currently have 163 out of 301 critters, totaling 54.15% of all critter types collected.

Other current critter stats:

Common: 50/62 (80.65% of all types collected)

Uncommon: 53/65 (81.54% of all types collected)

Rare: 44/64 (68.75% of all types collected)

Legendary: 4/50 (08.00% of all types collected)

Limited: 10/60 (16.67% of all types collected)

## Glitches

### Sky glitch

<!-- Notes 2021.12.17
Sky glitch (own section in status file) occurs at branch 35-41, occurs only when scrolling down, resets once you go back down to branch 33, if you go slow enough, the glitch doesn't trigger
!-->

The sky glitch seems to occur at around branches 35 to 41, and only activates when scrolling down. It cuts the background out at this range, and only shows blackness. It resets once you go back down to branch 33. If you go slow enough the glitch doesn't trigger.

**Observations as of 2021, Friday, December 17th**

The glitch seems to also happen if you open the navbar of your device, even if you aren't scrolling in the game.

**This observation is as of 2021, Sunday, December 26th**

### Critter duplication glitch

On 2021 Thursday December 23rd, I accidentally performed the critter duplication glitch by pressing the cancel button before it completely loaded. I got an extra Armadillo. I did not want to perform the glitch, I might evict the critter.

### Critter disappearing glitch

I have commonly noted that upon loading the game, several critters on branches don't load. You have to scroll past the branch and scroll back for them to reload. If you scroll midway, and back down, the critter will load as a white box (sprite) until you go off screen and come back.

This glitch is similar to the critter loading glitch, but is completely different from the critter deletion glitch.

### Critter loading glitch

See above: I don't know what causes this, but as of 2022 March 1st, upon loading the game, 1 critter has a watchclock icon but doesn't load until you scroll up and back down.

### Critter deletion glitch

I don't know what causes this, earlier on in my Tree World for Android days, one of my critters disappeared off my tree and never came back. I was unable to recover it.

## Potential glitches

### Vitagem-tree food swap glitch

I heard a rumor early on when I was playing this game again, noting that someone claimed there was a glitch where the game crashes, and your vitagems/tree food swap. It is not confirmed, however. I have not encountered it yet as of 2022 March 21st
